Hello! I am @thelearner411. I enjoy coding all sorts of coding projects. My specialty is application development, mainly for the web, but I also do mobile application development. I also delve into Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Please check out the projects in my repository. Do not be shy to reach out if you would like to collaborate on anything.

<p>Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am the thelearner411 - a Full-Stack Software and Artificial Intelligence Engineer.</p> 
  
Here you will find repositories of tech projects that I have worked on. I am passionate about delivering useful and robust web and mobile applications at every stage of the development process - from the skeleton of the database to the backend configuration to the frontend styling.

Moreover, I delve into Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning as some of my projects call for the implementation of Artificial Intelligence.

Please take a look at my repositories. Do not be shy to reach out if you would like to collaborate on any project.
